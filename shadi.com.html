  <div class="container">
    <div class="o">
      <p><strong>Dating 101:</strong> When on a date, switch off your phone. Nothing is more insulting to a girl than a man answering every call while on a date. You are allowed to make a small deal about turning off your phone at the start of the date with a comment like "Now we will not be disturbed". Power down your phone or lose your date. Can't have both.</p>
      <a href="./shaditips.html"><img src="https://github.com/Rachanasrinivasm/portfolio11/blob/main1/dating_101_lrg.jpg?raw=true" alt=""></a>
    </div>
    <div class="o">
      <p><strong>Dating 102:</strong> Leave your ego at home. A lot of guys are too sensitive. If she giggles because you made a small mistake, instead of getting angry or defensive, try laughing at yourself. Remember she is as nervous as you are (or more!) and it could just be her nerves showing. <br><br>
            Another ego issue is your treatment of people around you. Waiters, valet, taxi drivers, or cooks may not follow your instructions. Your interaction with these people will show her how you will act with her when the newness has worn out. Always be kind, generous, and forgiving. (That last one is something we should all aspire to all the time).</p>
